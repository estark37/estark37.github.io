Hello! I'm a software engineer and manager working on the Google Chrome web
browser. I lead Chrome's "Trusty Transport" team. We provide a foundation of
trustworthy, understandable encrypted and authenticated connections for the web.
We work on HTTPS certificate verification, ecosystem improvements like
Certificate Transparency, the TLS stack, and connection security UX (such as
site identity in the address bar and certificate warnings). I also co-lead a
cross-functional virtual team of usable security experts who provide consulting
and security reviews across Chrome. Much of my work involves quantitative field
[research](publications.html) about how Chrome's security features work. Some of
my major Chrome projects have included: promoting HTTPS adoption, improving and
resolving unnecessary HTTPS certificate errors, building tools to help
developers roll out more secure configurations, and building new warnings for
spoofy domains.

I've worked on Chrome for about 7 years. Before that, I was a core developer on
Meteor, a JavaScript application framework.

I received my bachelor's degree from Stanford University and master's degree
from MIT (both in computer science). As a student, most of my research centered
on deploying client-side cryptography in web applications. I still stay involved
in the academic research community by publishing papers about my work on Chrome
and serving on program committees.

Outside of work, I live with my spouse and two sons in the San
Francisco Bay Area. I enjoy baking, reading, yoga, and hiking in my free time.
