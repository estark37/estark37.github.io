Hello! I'm a software engineer working on the Google Chrome web browser. I lead
Chrome's usable security team. We build features in Chrome that help people make
safe decisions on the web. We also conduct quantitative field
[research](publications.html) about how these features work and consult
extensively with other teams as part of Chrome's security review process. Some
of my major Chrome projects have included: promoting HTTPS adoption, improving
and resolving unnecessary HTTPS certificate errors, building tools to help
developers roll out more secure configurations, and building new warnings for
spoofy domains.

I've worked on Chrome for about 5 years. Before that, I was a core developer on
Meteor, a JavaScript application framework.

I received my bachelor's degree from Stanford University and master's degree
from MIT (both in computer science). As a student, most of my research centered
on deploying client-side cryptography in web applications. I still stay involved
in the academic research community by publishing papers about my work on Chrome
and serving on program committees.

Outside of work, I live with my husband and ~~one~~ two! year old son in the San
Francisco Bay Area. I enjoy baking, reading, yoga, and hiking in my free time.
