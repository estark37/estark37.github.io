Hello! I'm a software engineer and manager working on the Google
Chrome web browser. I lead Chrome's Secure Web and Network team,
responsible for web platform and transport security. Some current
areas of focus for my team include the Chrome Root Program and
certificate verification, Chrome's underlying TLS and cryptography
library (BoringSSL), post-quantum cryptography, mitigating cross-site
leaks, and expanding the cryptographic capabilities of web
applications. I also lead a cross-functional virtual team of usable
security experts who provide consulting and security reviews across
Chrome. Throughout my time working on Chrome, I have promoted adoption
and secure configuration of HTTPS, built new detection heuristics and
warnings for spoofy domains, improved security UX more broadly, and
participated in or led various
[field research and measurement](publications.html) projects.

I received my bachelor's degree from Stanford University and master's degree
from MIT (both in computer science). As a student, most of my research centered
on deploying client-side cryptography in web applications. I still stay involved
in the academic research community by publishing papers about my work on Chrome
and serving on program committees.

Outside of work, I live with my spouse and two sons in the San
Francisco Bay Area. I enjoy baking, reading, yoga, and hiking in my free time.
